# Stage 6 Test Summary - TTL Expiration

## Overview
Stage 6 introduces **Time-To-Live (TTL)** expiration mechanism to the LRU cache, allowing entries to automatically expire after a specified time period.

**Test Status**: ✅ **ALL 9 TESTS PASSING**

## Test Results

### Test 1: xy7 - Basic TTL Expiration
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT a 1 1        # Put with TTL=1 second
GET a            # Immediately get (should return 1)
SLEEP 1.5        # Wait for expiration
GET a            # Get after expiration (should return NULL)
SIZE             # Verify cache size is 0
```

**Expected Output**: 
- PUT → OK
- GET → 1 (before expiration)
- GET → NULL (after expiration)
- SIZE → 0 (expired entry removed)

**What it Tests**:
- Basic TTL expiration functionality
- Lazy deletion (entry removed on access)
- SIZE reflects expired entries after deletion

---

### Test 2: xy7-immediate - Immediate Access Before TTL Expiration
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT a 1 2        # Put with TTL=2 seconds
GET a            # Get before expiration
SLEEP 0.5        # Wait 0.5s (still valid)
GET a            # Get again (still valid)
SIZE
```

**Expected Output**:
- All GET operations return the value (1)
- Entry does NOT expire before TTL

**What it Tests**:
- Entries are accessible before TTL expires
- No premature expiration

---

### Test 3: xy7-multiple - Multiple Entries with Different TTLs
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT short 1 1    # Expires after 1s
PUT medium 2 3   # Expires after 3s
PUT long 3 10    # Expires after 10s
SLEEP 1.5        # Wait 1.5s
GET short        # Should be NULL (expired)
GET medium       # Should return 2 (still valid)
SIZE             # Should be 3 (short still in cache)
GET long         # Should return 3 (still valid)
SIZE             # Should be 2 (short now removed)
```

**Expected Output**:
- `short` expires after 1s
- `medium` and `long` remain valid
- SIZE correctly reflects lazy deletion

**What it Tests**:
- Multiple entries with independent TTLs
- Each entry expires independently
- Lazy deletion triggered by GET

---

### Test 4: xy7-eviction - TTL with LRU Eviction
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 2           # Capacity=2
PUT a 1 1        # TTL=1s
PUT b 2 5        # TTL=5s
PUT c 3 5        # TTL=5s, evicts 'a' (LRU)
SLEEP 1.5        # 'a' would have expired anyway
GET a            # NULL (evicted)
GET b            # Should return 2 (not evicted)
SIZE             # Should be 2
```

**Expected Output**:
- LRU eviction works independently of TTL
- Expired entries can also be evicted by LRU

**What it Tests**:
- TTL and LRU eviction work together
- Eviction happens before expiration
- No memory leaks from expired entries

---

### Test 5: xy7-no-expiration - Entries Without TTL
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT a 100        # No TTL
PUT b 200        # No TTL
SLEEP 5          # Long wait
GET a            # Should still return 100
GET b            # Should still return 200
SIZE             # Should be 2
```

**Expected Output**:
- Entries without TTL never expire
- Values persist indefinitely

**What it Tests**:
- Backward compatibility (entries without TTL)
- Optional TTL parameter works correctly

---

### Test 6: xy7-mixed - Mixed TTL and No-TTL Entries
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT temp 1 1     # TTL=1s
PUT perm 2       # No TTL
SLEEP 1.5        # Only 'temp' expires
GET temp         # NULL (expired)
GET perm         # Should return 2
SIZE             # Should be 1
```

**Expected Output**:
- TTL entries expire
- No-TTL entries persist
- Both types can coexist

**What it Tests**:
- Mixed cache behavior
- TTL and no-TTL entries don't interfere

---

### Test 7: xy7-update - PUT Update Resets TTL
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT a 1 1        # TTL=1s
SLEEP 0.5        # Wait 0.5s
PUT a 2 1        # Update with new TTL=1s (resets timer)
SLEEP 0.7        # Total 1.2s from first PUT, but 0.7s from update
GET a            # Should return 2 (not expired)
SIZE             # Should be 1
```

**Expected Output**:
- PUT update resets TTL timer
- New TTL starts from update time, not original PUT

**What it Tests**:
- TTL reset behavior on update
- Correct timestamp calculation

---

### Test 8: xy7-size - SIZE Consistency with Lazy Deletion
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT a 1 1
PUT b 2 1
PUT c 3 1        # All expire after 1s
SIZE             # Should be 3 (before expiration)
SLEEP 1.5        # All expire
SIZE             # Should be 3 (lazy deletion, no access yet)
GET a            # NULL (triggers deletion)
SIZE             # Should be 2
GET b            # NULL (triggers deletion)
SIZE             # Should be 1
GET c            # NULL (triggers deletion)
SIZE             # Should be 0
```

**Expected Output**:
- SIZE includes expired entries until accessed
- Each GET removes one expired entry
- Final SIZE is 0

**What it Tests**:
- Lazy deletion semantics
- SIZE behavior with expired entries
- No active cleanup (no background threads)

---

### Test 9: xy7-concurrent - TTL with Concurrent Operations
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Scenario**:
```
INIT 5
PUT a 1 1
PUT b 2 1
PUT c 3 1        # All expire after 1s
SLEEP 1.5        # All expire
CONCURRENT 10 READ_HEAVY  # Concurrent access
GET a            # NULL (all expired)
GET b            # NULL
GET c            # NULL
```

**Expected Output**:
- TTL works correctly with thread safety
- Concurrent operations don't cause race conditions
- All expired entries return NULL

**What it Tests**:
- Thread-safe TTL operations
- No race conditions with expiration
- Lock protects expiration checks

---

## Implementation Details

### New Features Added

1. **Node.expire_at Field**:
   ```python
   class Node:
       def __init__(self, key, value, expire_at=None):
           self.expire_at = expire_at  # Unix timestamp
   ```

2. **GET Method - Expiration Check**:
   ```python
   def get(self, key: str) -> str:
       if key in self.cache:
           node = self.cache[key]
           # Check expiration
           if node.expire_at and time.time() >= node.expire_at:
               self._remove_expired(key)
               return "NULL"
           # ... rest of GET logic
   ```

3. **PUT Method - TTL Parameter**:
   ```python
   def put(self, key: str, value: str, ttl: int = None):
       expire_at = None
       if ttl is not None:
           expire_at = time.time() + ttl
       # ... create/update node with expire_at
   ```

4. **SLEEP Command**:
   ```python
   if parts[0] == "SLEEP":
       seconds = float(parts[1])
       time.sleep(seconds)
       return "OK"
   ```

5. **Lazy Deletion Helper**:
   ```python
   def _remove_expired(self, key: str):
       """Remove an expired entry from the cache."""
       node = self.cache[key]
       self._remove_node(node)
       del self.cache[key]
       self.size -= 1
   ```

### Code Changes
- **Lines Changed**: +32 lines (261 → 293 lines)
- **New Methods**: `_remove_expired()`
- **Modified Methods**: `get()`, `put()`, command parsing
- **Backward Compatible**: Entries without TTL work as before

### Design Decisions

1. **Lazy Deletion**:
   - Expired entries remain in cache until accessed
   - Simpler implementation (no background threads)
   - SIZE includes expired entries

2. **Thread Safety**:
   - Same lock protects all operations
   - Expiration check happens inside lock
   - No race conditions

3. **TTL Reset on Update**:
   - PUT update resets TTL timer
   - New expire_at calculated from update time

4. **Optional TTL**:
   - Entries without TTL never expire
   - Backward compatible with earlier stages

## Common Pitfalls

The tests include educational hints for common mistakes:

1. **Forgetting to check expiration in GET**:
   - Hint: "Make sure to check if entry has expired before returning value"

2. **Using wrong time for expiration**:
   - Hint: "expire_at should be current_time + ttl, not just ttl"

3. **Not resetting TTL on update**:
   - Hint: "PUT update should reset the TTL timer"

4. **SIZE not reflecting lazy deletion**:
   - Hint: "Expired entries should remain in cache until accessed"

5. **Thread safety issues with TTL**:
   - Hint: "Expiration check should be inside the lock"

6. **Premature expiration**:
   - Hint: "Check should be >= expire_at, not > expire_at"

---

## Next Steps

Stage 6 is **COMPLETE** ✅

3. ✅ Test suite created (9 tests)
4. ✅ All tests passing
5. ⏳ Commit and push changes
