# Stage 5 (Thread Safety) - Test Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive testing suite for Stage 5 (Thread Safety - ba6) of the LRU Cache course.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **src/stage_5.rs** (NEW)
- Created complete test suite with 9 test functions
- Total: 238 lines of code
- Pattern: Uses `CacheTestCase` abstraction for consistency

### 2. **src/lib.rs** (MODIFIED)
- Added `pub mod stage_5;` to expose the module

### 3. **src/bin/main.rs** (MODIFIED)
- Registered 9 Stage 5 tests in the `register_tests!` macro
- Test slugs: ba6, ba6-read-heavy, ba6-write-heavy, ba6-stress, ba6-sequential, ba6-lru-preserved, ba6-size-consistency, ba6-capacity-one, ba6-after-concurrent

### 4. **Makefile** (MODIFIED)
- Added `STAGE5_BASIC` and `STAGE5_ALL` test case configurations
- Added `.PHONY` targets: `test_stage5`, `test_stage5_all`, `test_solution_stage5`, `test_solution_stage5_all`
- Added Make targets: `test_solution_stage5` and `test_solution_stage5_all`
- Updated help documentation

## Test Cases Implemented

| # | Test Slug | Description | Focus |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `ba6` | Thread-safe basic operations | Verify locks don't break basic functionality |
| 2 | `ba6-read-heavy` | Concurrent READ_HEAVY (70% reads) | Test with 10 threads, read-dominated workload |
| 3 | `ba6-write-heavy` | Concurrent WRITE_HEAVY (90% writes) | High contention with 20 threads |
| 4 | `ba6-stress` | Stress test (50 threads, capacity=2) | Extreme stress with frequent evictions |
| 5 | `ba6-sequential` | Multiple CONCURRENT in sequence | Consistency across sequential concurrent ops |
| 6 | `ba6-lru-preserved` | LRU behavior under concurrent load | Verify eviction logic remains correct |
| 7 | `ba6-size-consistency` | SIZE consistency (3 rounds) | Detect race conditions in SIZE tracking |
| 8 | `ba6-capacity-one` | CONCURRENT with capacity=1 | Extreme contention edge case |
| 9 | `ba6-after-concurrent` | Operations after CONCURRENT | Verify cache remains usable |

## Key Testing Patterns

### CONCURRENT Command Format
```
CONCURRENT <num_threads> <workload_pattern>

Workload patterns:
- READ_HEAVY: 70% reads, 30% writes
- WRITE_HEAVY: 10% reads, 90% writes
- MIXED: 50% reads, 50% writes
```

### Test Verification Points

1. **No Crashes/Deadlocks**: All threads complete successfully
2. **Capacity Enforcement**: SIZE never exceeds capacity
3. **Data Consistency**: No corrupted pointers or lost updates
4. **Lock Correctness**: All operations properly protected
5. **Performance**: Tests complete in reasonable time (~1 second per CONCURRENT)

## Test Results

✅ **All 9 tests PASSING** with the Stage 5 reference solution

### Sample Output
```
stage-5.1 ✓ Testing basic operations with thread safety
stage-5.2 ✓ Testing concurrent reads and writes (READ_HEAVY workload)
stage-5.3 ✓ Testing concurrent writes with high contention (WRITE_HEAVY workload)
stage-5.4 ✓ Testing stress with small capacity (MIXED workload)
stage-5.5 ✓ Testing multiple concurrent operations in sequence
stage-5.6 ✓ Testing that LRU behavior is preserved under concurrent load
stage-5.7 ✓ Testing SIZE consistency under concurrent load
stage-5.8 ✓ Testing CONCURRENT with capacity=1 (extreme contention)
stage-5.9 ✓ Testing operations work correctly after CONCURRENT
```

## Usage

### Run Basic Stage 5 Test
```bash
cd lru-cache-tester
make test_solution_stage5
```

### Run All Stage 5 Tests
```bash
cd lru-cache-tester
make test_solution_stage5_all
```

### Test Custom Implementation
```bash
cd lru-cache-tester
SYSTEMQUEST_REPOSITORY_DIR=/path/to/your/impl \
SYSTEMQUEST_TEST_CASES_JSON='[{"slug":"ba6-stress","tester_log_prefix":"stress","title":"Stress Test"}]' \
make test_custom
```

## Common Issues Detected by Tests

### 1. **Race Conditions**
- **Test**: `ba6-size-consistency`
- **Symptom**: SIZE > capacity
- **Cause**: Eviction check not atomic with insertion

### 2. **Deadlock**
- **Test**: `ba6-write-heavy`
- **Symptom**: Program hangs
- **Cause**: Nested lock acquisition or lock not released

### 3. **Corrupted Data Structures**
- **Test**: `ba6-stress`
- **Symptom**: Crashes or NULL pointer errors
- **Cause**: DLL pointers corrupted by concurrent operations

### 4. **Lost Updates**
- **Test**: `ba6-after-concurrent`
- **Symptom**: PUT/GET after CONCURRENT returns wrong values
- **Cause**: Not all operations protected by lock

## Educational Hints

Each test includes detailed educational hints:

```rust
.with_hint(
    "WRITE_HEAVY workload (90% writes) creates high lock contention. \
    Verify that:\n\
    1. Capacity is strictly enforced (SIZE = 3)\n\
    2. No lost updates or race conditions\n\
    3. Eviction logic works correctly under concurrent load"
)
```

## Testing Philosophy

Following CodeCrafters patterns:
1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Basic → Stress → Edge cases
2. **Educational Feedback**: Hints explain what's being tested and why
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 9 tests cover all concurrency scenarios
4. **Real-World Relevance**: Tests mirror production use cases

## Integration with Course

- **Stage Definition**: Matches `course-definition.yml` (slug: ba6)
- **Description**: Aligns with `stage_descriptions/base-05-ba6.md`
- **Solution**: Tested with `lru-cache-solution-dev/python/05-ba6/code/`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Stage 5 tests implemented and passing
2. ⏳ Implement Stage 6 (TTL Expiration - xy7)
3. ⏳ Implement Stage 7 (Cache Statistics - st8)

## Performance Notes

- Each CONCURRENT command runs for ~1 second
- Total test suite execution time: ~15-20 seconds
- Suitable for CI/CD pipelines
- No external dependencies beyond Python threading
